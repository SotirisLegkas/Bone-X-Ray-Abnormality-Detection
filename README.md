X-Ray classification

Given a study containing X-Ray images, build a deep learning model that decides if the study is normal or abnormal. You must use at least 2 different architectures, one with your own CNN model (e.g., you can use a model similar to the CNN of the previous project) and one with a popular CNN pre-trained CNN model (e.g., VGG-19, ResNet, etc.). Use the MURA dataset to train and evaluate your models.

More information about the task and the dataset can be found at https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/competitions/mura/.
